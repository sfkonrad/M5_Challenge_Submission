## **Financial Planning with APIs and Simulations**
For this Project, we created two financial analysis tools for a local Credit Union by using a single Jupyter notebook:
### 
### **Part 1: Financial Planner for Emergencies** 
> The members are now able to use this tool to visualize their current savings. Further, they can then determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.

### **Part 2: Financial Planner for Retirement** 
> This tool forecasts the performance of the member's retirement portfolio over 30 years. To do this, we developed a tool that makes Alpaca API calls via the Alpaca SDK to obtain both live and historical price data for use in our Monte Carlo simulations.

We then use the statistics generated from the Monte Carlo simulation(s) to answer critical questions about the portfolio in our Jupyter notebook.
